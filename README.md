This project was carried out while studying at the University of Montpellier in 2022.
This RESTful API uses SpringBoot in order to publish web services designed for a hotel management context.
The project folder contains both a server that needs to be launched in order to publish the microservices, and a separate client application that consumes those services.

The Hotel RESTful API allows the user to, _inter alia_ :
  - Check available hotels in an area;
  - Get special discounts depending on the agency that the client is logged as;
  - Check availabilities of a particular room;
  - Make a booking, using a valid agency as well as an available room.
